# MarioKart64 Environment

This page describes the Super Smash Bros environment(s).

## Configuration

A configuration file ([`smash_config.yml`](smash_config.yml)) has been provided for this game. Currently the only configuration setting is `ROM_PATH`. This setting must specify the full path to the Super Smash Bros ROM on your system.

Additionally, make sure you either have all items and levels unlocked in your save file, or copy smash.sra (included
in this directory) to your Mupen64 Super Smash Bros save file, likely
~/.local/share/mupen64plus/save/Super\ Smash\ Bros.\ \(U\)\ \[\!\].sra

## Implementation Details

### `SmashEnv`:

#### Methods:

* Implementation of base abstract methods:
    * `_navigate_menu()` moves through the game menu from startup to the beginning of a match.

    * `_get_reward()` determines the reward for each step.
        * There are rewards for dealing damages and getting kills, and costs if you take damage or die.
        * There is a reward for taunting.
        * There is a penalty for going too long without giving or taking damage, or taunting.

    * `_evaluate_end_state()` Always returns false for now. Assumes an infinite run time.

    * `_reset()` resets to begin a new match. Assumes an infinite run time.

### Action Space:

For the definitions of possible discrete actions, see `discrete_envs.py`

### Sample Script:

You can run the following script to confirm everything is working:

```python
#!/bin/python
import gym, gym_mupen64plus

def main():
    env = gym.make('Smash-mario-v0')
    env.reset()
    env.render()
    for i in range(1000):
        # Taunt.
        (obs, rew, end, info) = env.step([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0])
        (obs, rew, end, info) = env.step([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
        env.render()

    #env.render()
    raw_input("Press <enter> to exit... ")

    env.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
